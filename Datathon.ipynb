      "Et tu, Rhody?  A recent editorial in the Providence Journal cataloged everything it could find wrong with Connecticut and ended with this suggestion: “Gov. Gina Raimondo should see if at least some of those jobs could come to Rhode Island. It is certainly less risky than the Nutmeg State.”  We beg your pardon.  The state with world-famous pension problems and persistent economic issues of its own is “less risky”?  The Journal itself reported just a few weeks ago on Rhode Island’s own significant economic problems, which in many ways reflect Connecticut’s.  Rhode Island enjoys a legacy of corruption that not even Connecticut can match. The ProJo won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994 for uncovering widespread corruption within its own court system.  What, exactly, is to be gained from moving to Rhode Island?  Like Connecticut, Rhode Island has an income tax and an estate tax with comparable rates. (Forbes magazine listed it as one of the states “Where Not To Die.” Connecticut made the list, too.)  Connecticut and Rhode Island’s interdependence has been limited, with the exception of the interstate economy created by Electric Boat in Groton. There have been no border wars and very little bloodshed. A few jokes about Rhode Island’s size, maybe, but if we’re being honest, Connecticut doesn’t really have a lot going on in that department either.  A little interstate competition is fine, but if Connecticut suffers, so does Rhode Island — and all of New England, for that matter.  Connecticut is losing residents at a troubling rate, but Rhode Island has an outmigration problem of its own. From 2015 to 2016, the Ocean State experienced a net loss of about 2,000 tax filers, who took with them more than $182 million in adjusted gross income. The top destination states for people who fled Rhode Island were Massachusetts, Florida and — wait for it — Connecticut.  Connecticut residents moved to Rhode Island as well, of course. But Connecticut’s population is 3½ times as big as Rhode Island’s. So the 1,175 tax filers who left Rhode Island for Connecticut represent a far larger portion of the Ocean State than the 1,220 who moved from Connecticut to Rhode Island. If any state should be concerned about losing residents to its neighbor, it’s Rhode Island.  But we don’t want to poach Rhode Islanders. We’d rather celebrate Electric Boat’s growth and the burgeoning workforce that supports both states. We’d rather cheer CVS for buying Aetna and keeping it in Hartford than try to woo CVS from Woonsocket.  A booming Connecticut, especially in the insurance and defense industries, only helps Rhode Island.  As Electric Boat — headquartered in Connecticut, might we emphasize — grows over the next decade, the effect on Little Rhody will be profound, as the ProJo’s editorial board pointed out. A thriving border economy helps both states as supplier chains develop and as feeder businesses bloom.  But for the same reasons that the stain of a Hartford bankruptcy would spread to the suburbs, if Connecticut becomes an economic wasteland, the effects would be felt across New England.  If Rhode Island and Connecticut want to find a way out of the muck, far better for them to work together.  Yes, Connecticut can learn from Rhode Island. Connecticut’s pension problems are similar to those that threatened to swamp Rhode Island, but there are key differences, especially in that Connecticut’s pensions are contractual, where in Rhode Island, they were set by state statute.  Rhode Island made some tough choices and anticipated a legal battle to solve its problems. Connecticut leaders might have to find the stomach for the same type of strategy.  Connecticut and Rhode Island have a lot in common, including language. We both drive around the rotary to get a grinder at Cumbie’s, for example. And we are glad that Rhode Island has made progress on its pension issues.  But that’s no reason to try to poach a few residents. A regional approach would be much wiser.\n",

      "© Saul Loeb Image: Members of Congress attend the State of the UnionMembers of Congress look on as President Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, on Jan. 30, 2018.  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump called Democrats' stone-faced reaction to his State of the Union address \"treasonous\" and \"un-American\" during a visit to a manufacturing plant in Cincinnati, Ohio Monday.  Trump described Republicans \"going totally crazy wild\" during his State of the Union remarks one week ago, while Democrats remained seated and stone-faced for the majority of the speech. \"They were like death,\" Trump lamented. \"And un-American. Un-American.\"  But the reaction, he said, was also something much worse.  Vaguely noting that \"someone\" called the Democratic reactions \"'treasonous,'\" Trump said he agreed. \"I mean, yeah, I guess. Why not?...Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn't seem to love our country very much.\"  Though the word has gotten plenty of attention in Washington of late, not standing during a speech certainly does not count as treason.  Trump's speech — billed by the White House as another push for the newly-passed Republican tax plan and \"not a political event\" — swung wildly from the tax package's finer selling points to the president's rosy outlook on 2018 while he leveled hard knocks against Democrats, specifically House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. As Trump spoke, the stock markets he once used as an example of his positive impact on the economy continued their downward slide.  \"[Pelosi]'s our secret weapon,\" Trump told the Ohio crowd. \"No, she's our secret weapon. I just hope they don't change her,\" he said, referencing Democrats who \"want to run her out\" of her leadership post.  The anti-Pelosi playbook isn't a new one, but it's one Republicans seem likely to brandish again as the 2018 midterms draw near. Recently, Vice President Mike Pence, top Republicans, and even Trump himself have seized on Pelosi's comments likening American monetary gains from the GOP tax bill to \"crumbs\"— a gaffe the president likened to Hillary Clinton's \"deplorables\" comment during the 2016 election.  Though historically the party in the White House faces tough losses in their first midterm election, President Trump believed he had the root of the problem in hand: electorate complacency.  \"I think I figured it out,\" he said, describing voters as \"happy\" in the aftermath of their side winning the White House, while the other party's supporters are \"desperate\" for a win and thusly more willing to get out and vote in midterm election years.  \"In the midterms, we've got to get out there and win,\" Trump decided, tagging Pelosi, and Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as \"so far left.\"  Trump then doled out at least a partial endorsement of GOP Senate hopeful and current congressman Jim Rinacci, pressing Ohioans to \"get Jim in\" and help Republicans earn \"tremendous success\" in 2018. \"If we don't, we're just foolish,\" Trump chided.  The president was looking past the midterms, too. \"We want to do great in '18, and we're going to do really well in '20,\" he said. \"That's when we go again and we keep this great journey going, okay?\"  But to get there, Trump will first have to overcome the ongoing Russia probe into his campaign's alleged collusion with the Kremlin. A newly-released, controversial Republican memo seeks to discredit information gathering tactics by the FBI and Justice Department, but doesn't actually vindicate Trump despite his tweets over the weekend claiming it did.  On Monday, the president celebrated catching \"them in the act,\" speaking in veiled terms but in an apparent reference to political opponents and law enforcement officials as he made the case for electing more Republicans to Congress.  \"We need them badly too, or it all goes back to where it was and worse,\" he said, interrupting himself to glorify the memo. \"Boy, did we catch them in the act or what? You know what I'm talking about. Oh, did we catch them in the act. They are very embarrassed. They never thought they were gonna get caught. We caught 'em...It's so much fun, we're like the great sleuth.\"  Though the White House did not draft the memo, they did support its public release. It remains unclear if they will come to the same conclusion with a corresponding memo from Democrats on the same topic.  The White House maintained before the rally that there was \"no consideration about any personnel moves at the Department of Justice\" when asked about Trump's confidence in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, one of the top DOJ officials named in the memo.  But that doesn't mean the memo won't herald any change at all. Asked about a second special counsel to look into the DOJ and FBI, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary *Raj Shah* told reporters aboard Air Force One Monday the president's personal attorney \"have called for further review and a second special counsel.\"\n",

      "© The Associated Press Cyrial Ramaphosa was elected South African president on Thursday, a day after the resignation of Jacob Zuma.  Cyril Ramaphosa has been elected as South Africa's president just hours after the country's scandal-plagued leader Jacob Zuma resigned on Wednesday.  Zuma heeded the orders of the ruling African National Congress to end to his nine years in power.  The ANC, which replaced Zuma as party leader in December with then Deputy President Ramaphosa, had ordered him to step down on Tuesday. When Zuma failed to resign, it announced it would back an opposition motion in parliament to force him out.  Ramaphosa, 65, has put the focus on rooting out corruption and revitalizing economic growth.\n",

      "Do you have the same taste in TV as the majority of the people in your state? The folks over at satellite provider USDish.com put together a map of the most popular '90s sitcom in each of the 50 states.  The company's data is from Google search interest from 2004 to the present, capturing the tail end of the run of some of these shows and the beginning of an era of fans constantly watching reruns on TV. It's no surprise that the universally popular Friends dominates the map, with 13 states claiming it as their most-watched show. It is not, however, New York's most-watched show: fellow New York City-set series Seinfeld has that honor. Out of the Friends contingent, six are states in the Midwest: perhaps these viewers are dreaming of leaving cornfields behind and moving to The City That Never Sleeps.  The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air came in second as the favorite of four states (Maryland, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina) plus Washington, D.C. Weirdly, Pennsylvania isn't in this group: Pennsylvanians' fave program is Step by Step. It's also the only state to choose Step by Step. Guess they really love family in PA!  There are a few other instances in which a show is claimed by the state in which it's set: Washington loves Seattle-centric Frasier; Ohio roots for the Cleveland-set Drew Carey Show; andWisconsin can't stop watching That '70s Show, which is set in fictional Point Place, Wisconsin.  Utah supports 3rd Rock from the Sun, which makes sense given that the state is a hotbed for UFO sightings. What about California, home of Hollywood and the beautiful people in the film and TV biz? Well, those beautiful people like to watch yellow cartoon people. That's right, The Simpsons is Cali's most-loved show.
